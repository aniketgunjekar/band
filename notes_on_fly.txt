create data base which is an array(or object whichever suits the situation) containing music names and associated key bindings

music names can be used to access file path as well as display the items

and key bindings can be used to display in pads elements and bind with respective keys stored in database.

add audio objects in dataBase and access them such that they evaluate to src value;

when you set the volume give volume access to display and setDisplay. setDisplay with volume info for a settimeout and back again display the previous display info. hint save the previous display info in a variable that can again be accessed after the setdiplay for volume times out;

try accessing display history or add mouse click off event

add timeout function to volume display feature or even better use onmouseout event trigger; -solved using regexp
and connect the volume to sound output

add event listeners to all the audio elements using for loop

next do state management througn redux
and connect react-redux;
